# Twitter Network Science

## Goal

Graph of my Twitter follows and their followers, so I can find appropriate connections.

Temporarily halting this project because `twint` as a package just sucks. Will try again later. Do better.

## Activate

```bash
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
